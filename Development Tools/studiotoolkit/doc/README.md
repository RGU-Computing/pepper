STK Python Modules
====================

The stk libraries provide helpers for common functionalities. They don't depend on each other, and can be integrated in applications.

Modules:

* [stk.runner](stk_runner.md), for running an application
* [stk.services](stk_services.md), for easy access to services
* [stk.logging](stk_logging.md) for logging
* [stk.events](stk_events.md), for ALMemory events, and signals

You can also see sample usage of these in the python/samples/ folder.

Javascript libraries
====================

Here are also some helper javascript libraries for common functionality.

* [robotutils.js](js_robotutils.md), a helper for using NAOqi services.
