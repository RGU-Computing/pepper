# SoC - Pepper

### Getting Started
**DO NOT CONNECT PEPPER TO EDUROAM**

First you need to connect pepper to wifi to be able to send new programs. 
The best way to do this is to connect your Laptop/Desktop to the internet via Ethernet and then share this ethernet via wifi.

### Info
The version of NAOqi installed on pepper is 2.5.10, this is the latest version designed for research & development. It allows full, low-level access to all pepper's systems. 
Some documentation refers to NAQqi 2.9 and QiSDK, these are the newer, but highly restricted OS & SDK. They are designed for end-users. QiSDK And NAOqi are not installed on our pepper (and can't be)
